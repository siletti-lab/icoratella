### GBM manipulation and tumor clustering analysis

The files uploaded in this folder pertain to the GBM test dataset, covering data manipulation, analysis, and images.

**1: `extracting_individual_samples_from_GBM.ipynb`**

In this notebook, I demonstrate how I extracted the sample SL040 from the full test dataset. This specific sample was then used for further analysis, including examining prediction results and performing clustering analysis on this individual sample.

**2: `GBM_manipulation_and_Figure_8.ipynb`**

In this notebook, I performed a computation of quality metrics for the glioblastoma test dataset and generation of Figure 8.

**3: `umap_tumor_clustering_sample_SL040.ipynb`**

In this notebook, I preprocessed sample SL040 and saved a processed copy. This prepared sample will be utilized for analyzing classifier predictions, and visualization. After the preprocessing, I conducted a tumor clustering analysis. I also generated panel A and B of **Figure 16**.

**4: `umap_tumor_clustering_sample_KS414.ipynb`**

In this notebook, I preprocessed the sample KS414 and saved a processed copy. This sample will be used for analyzing classifier predictions and for visualization purposes. Following the preprocessing, I performed a tumor clustering analysis. In this notebook I also generated panel A and B of **Figure 17**.
